# Time Profiler Visualizer
This project include a minimalist C++ library for time profiling with and 
an appImage to visualise the elapsed time data generated by the labrary.


## Motivation

When profiling elapsed time of an application or part of an application,
we usually end repeating the test multiple times and comparing the resulting
data visually.

This library will keep track of the elapsed time and output a .js file
that can be loaded by 

## AppImage

[Time Profiler Visualizer](https://github.com/volatilflerovium/time_profiler_visualizer/releases)
is available as an AppImage which means "one app = one file", which you can download and run on your
Linux system while you don't need a package manager and nothing gets changed
in your system.

AppImages are single-file applications that run on most Linux distributions.
Download it, make it executable, and run! No need to install.
No system libraries or system preferences are altered.
Most AppImages run on recent versions of Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora,
openSUSE, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and other common desktop distributions.

## Example

```
  profiler::TimeProfiler<std::chrono::microseconds> timeProfiler("someName", "#colour").
  
  //example 1)
  
  do_loop{
  	do something
  
     timeProfiler.start()
     do something else
     timeProfiler.takeSample(true)    // here we capture individual samples
   
    do more stuff
  
  }
  
  //example 2)
  
  do_loop{
  	do something
  
     timeProfiler.start()
     do something else
     timeProfiler.pause()    // here we pause the clock
   
    do more stuff
  
  }
  
  timeProfiler.takeSample(true); // here we capture the average of the elapsed time
                         // of the do_something_else task
  
```
